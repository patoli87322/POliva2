      <h2>So this is Me</h2>

	     <p> Bonjour, My name is Patricia Oliva. I am a sofware engineer and psychology major. I am also minoring in mathematics.
		     I am honestly just trying to survive, and not die off instantly as i am essentially two chicken nuggets stacked
		     on top of each other trying to resemble a person. When i have a free moment I enjoy
		     
		     
		     Hello - My name is Estherson, but around here I go by Lukas. I'm a college student just trying to get through

	Life at the moment. I'm studying software engineering in order to create products that will benefit the world one day.

	Even so, I do other things I find fun, cooking especially, but graphic design, music, and so much more are things that I've

	Dabbled in and continue to whenever I get the inspiration to.

          </p>

	   <p> Beyond the screen and school work, I play football, enjoy soccer, and am learning to play basketball. I have a terrible golf swing as well but that doesn't stop me from trying.

		   And isn't that the point of it all. To do the best we can.

	   </p>

	   <p> honestly I rabble on and make things speeches, but the best way to get my attention, shoot me an email. Let’s see how things go

		   And have a good time working together.

		  <h2>Hobbies</h2>

          <p>as I said I am a comic book fan, I plan to go watch the movie Avengers: Endgame. This movie is the end of the connected MCU which will include other heroes 

As Iron Man or Captain America. Marvel is considered to have better movies as some movies in the DCCU (DC Cinematic Universe) have flopped

Like Green Lantern while there standalone films like the Dark Knight, Man of Steel, etc. are good. This being said the 

MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) is also considered better because of its size and movies flowing together well as it started back in 2008 

With The Hulk.<br/><font color="red">Side Note: </font>This opinion is also heavily biased when referring to comics, although universes 

Being darker, and how movies are considered are not heavily biased but stated as pure observations. Including enjoying comics, I also 

Like to listen to music. In this respect I consider music to be the only thing that keeps me alive often enough. I enjoy listening to most types

of music and listen to artists such as Red, Linkin Park, Machine Gun Kelly, Kevin Gates, Raliegh Ritchie, SK8, and so much more. This

sparked a time in high school when I was in Hip-Hop Dance Club and made song mixes for it.

				<h2>My life</h2>

          <p align="right"><i>I do not know what else to tell about me. I am pretty random and a spur of the moment kind of person. I enjoy working

out, and anime obviously, but also I like to do things last minute and late at night for my best work and making sure everything 

is correct. Things such as typing up an html document is not fun but necessary for a class such as the one I am in currently even 

though I am certified in Adobe Dreamweaver. Under this this is a video of one of my favorite songs by Machine Gun Kelly. It is a song that helped me get through a tough time in life.</i>
