      <h2>So this is Me</h2>

	     <p> Bonjour, My name is Patricia Oliva. I am a sofware engineer and psychology major.
		     I am also minoring in mathematics, because i hate myself but am good at math.
		     I am honestly just trying to survive, and not die off instantly as i am essentially two chicken nuggets stacked
		     on top of each other hiding under a trench coat trying to resemble a person.
		    
          </p>

	   <p>     When i have a free moment I enjoy watching Anime, reading, painting and playing volleyball.
		   While of course listening to the most depressing music known to existance. 
		   Why you may ask, it is soothing and suprisingly makes me happy.
		   I am dying.

	   </p> I can be an extremely eccentric person but i mean well. 
	   I am usually a mess and not even a hot one at that. 
	   My closests friends have a conspiracy theory that I was secretly a dog in a previous life, and I am not even going to deny it, because I whole heartedly agree. 

	   <p>

		  <h2>What I do if I actually have free time</h2>

          <p> So I am a big flipping nerd and Weeaboo.
		 I have a huge collection of Deadpool based merchandise ranging from hoodies, costumes and stuffies to Pop Funkos and other collectibles.
		When I am not feeding my collection I am trying to feed myself something besides Ramen, I love Food and I am not afraid to show it, as i always have a plethora of snacks.
		  When I attempt to conform to society I fail, horribly. So like the weak willed person I am I gave up and I am much Happier for it.
		  If the Gods have blessed my friends and I with a time slot that we are all free we will all hang out. 
		  	We typically nerd out together and when you put the introverts together, we are a force to be reckoned with.

				<h2>My life</h2>

          <p align="right"><i>I do not know what else to tell about me. I am pretty random and a spur of the moment kind of person. I enjoy working

out, and anime obviously, but also I like to do things last minute and late at night for my best work and making sure everything 

is correct. Things such as typing up an html document is not fun but necessary for a class such as the one I am in currently even 

though I am certified in Adobe Dreamweaver. Under this this is a video of one of my favorite songs by Machine Gun Kelly. It is a song that helped me get through a tough time in life.</i>
