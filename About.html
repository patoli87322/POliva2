      <h2>So this is Me</h2>

	     <p> Bonjour, My name is Patricia Oliva. I am a sofware engineer and psychology major.
		     I am also minoring in mathematics, because i hate myself but am good at math.
		     I am honestly just trying to survive, and not die off instantly as i am essentially two chicken nuggets stacked
		     on top of each other hiding under a trench coat trying to resemble a person.
		    
          </p>

	   <p>     When i have a free moment I enjoy watching Anime, reading, painting and playing volleyball.
		   While of course listening to the most depressing music known to existance. 
		   Why you may ask, it is soothing and suprisingly makes me happy.
		   I am dying.

	   </p> I can be an extremely eccentric person but i mean well. 
	   I am usually a mess and not even a hot one at that. 
	   My closests friends have a conspiracy theory that I was secretly a dog in a previous life, and I am not even going to deny it, because I whole heartedly agree. 

	   <p>

		  <h2>What I do if I actually have free time</h2>

          <p> So I am a big flipping nerd and Weeaboo.
		 I have a huge collection of Deadpool based merchandise ranging from hoodies, costumes and stuffies to Pop Funkos and other collectibles.
		When I am not feeding my collection I am trying to feed myself something besides Ramen, I love Food and I am not afraid to show it, as i always have a plethora of snacks.
		  When I attempt to conform to society I fail, horribly. So like the weak willed person I am I gave up and I am much Happier for it.
		  If the Gods have blessed my friends and I with a time slot that we are all free we will all hang out. 
		  	We typically nerd out together and when you put the introverts together, we are a force to be reckoned with.

		  
          </p>

				<h2>My life</h2>

          <p align="right"><i> Well besides being a complete Dork, I also enjoy memes.
		  I usually prefer dark memes that compliment my existential dread however my boyfriend enjoys sending me wholesome memes.
		  Which i do not deserve. The most wholesome thing about me is that i absolutely love all animals.
          </p>
		  <p>My ultimate super ultra-serotonin+dopamine combo is volunteering at the Gulf Coast Humane Society.
			  At the GCHS i can start my training early on so that i can be the best crazy cat lady i can be by the tender age of 25.
			 My second favorite serotonin+dopamine+oxytocin combo is watching anime while cuddling my boyfriend. 
			  And then mourning charachter deaths for the next 7 years. Damn you Endgame!!!
